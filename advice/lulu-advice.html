                <h4>Don't be Afraid! Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code you are doing something that you have never dared to do before. It's a totally new challenge, a brand new opportunity, and possibly so different and foreign that none of your friends or family have ever done it before. But at the same time,
                   it's totally attainable. I used to be averse to technology and was always the last person to embrace it. And lastly, I never thought I'd make it through my first HTML class, but I did. And guess what? I had made it out to be much scarier that it actually was. It sounds cliche,
                   but if I was able to do it, anyone can!</p>

                <p>Confusion and a little bit of fear, therefore, are signs that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the creative and problem solving pursuit of technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity and a new world awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                   You're thinking who in the world came up with and figured out all of this!</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical and necessary part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

              <div class="third-width">
                <h4>Don't Give Up. Keep on Going!</h4>
                <p>It took me a little bit of time to open up to learning again but once I did, I'd become more curious which each little excercise that I'd complete and it just made me want to keep going.  Kind of like reading a good book or binging on a new drama on Netflix --
                   you can't wait to turn the page or get to the next episode!

                <p>Don't get me wrong. You might get stuck along the way, so don't hesitate to reach out to Skillcrush for help. They're just a quick Slack message away and seriously, within no time you'll be "unstuck", have clarity and will be well again on your way!
